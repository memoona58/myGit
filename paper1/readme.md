## Introduction
 This research paper is about the Collabrative work of employess and their measurement for software development values. AS software development is arising rapidly and become a collabrative process of taking part in online hosting programming services. ***For Example:*** Github , Bitbucket or Gitlab. Developers are doing collective work as software engineering is providing enormous facilities. __Github__ is a repository hosting services, it is providing web graphical interface , access controll and collabrative features. In these collabrative materials , software projects are the combinations of different contribution. This collabration is a multiple axes having so many things from coding a project to its debugging process, it includes each and  every information. Thus all the data combine and form a **"History"** of all project containing answers of every ___W.H Question___.
 #### Motivation
The basic motive of is the ***History*** of the project is consider as ***Agile Methedoloy*** having goal of building high quality software. The ***Github*** infrastructure examines all the data contribution. Summup the employees contibutions and quality measurement that answer every arsing question.
